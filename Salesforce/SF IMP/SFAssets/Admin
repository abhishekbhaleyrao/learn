# 👥 User Setup & Security in Salesforce

User Setup & Security ensures the **right people** in the organization get the **right level of access** to Salesforce data and features.  
It is the backbone of **data security, compliance, and governance** in Salesforce.

---

## 📌 Key Concepts

| Feature                  | Description | Example |
|--------------------------|-------------|---------|
| **User**                 | A person with login access to Salesforce | Sales Rep, Manager |
| **Profile**              | Defines what a user can do in Salesforce (object-level & system permissions) | Sales Profile |
| **Permission Set**       | Grants additional permissions without changing profile | Extra access to Reports |
| **Role**                 | Defines data visibility in the org (role hierarchy) | Manager sees subordinates records |
| **Sharing Rules**        | Exceptions to org-wide defaults (OWD) | Share Opportunities with Marketing |
| **Login Access Policies**| Controls how users log in (MFA, IP restrictions, hours) | Only allow login from India |
| **Password Policies**    | Defines complexity, expiry, lockout | Min 8 chars, expires in 90 days |



## ⚙️ Steps in Salesforce Setup

### 1. **Creating a User**
- Go to **Setup → Users → Users → New User**
- Enter details: First Name, Last Name, Email, Username (must be unique), Role, Profile
- Example: Create user *Rohit Sharma* (Sales Rep, Profile = Standard User, Role = Sales Executive)

![User Setup](images/user_setup.png)

---

### 2. **Profiles**
- **Profiles control access** to:
  - Objects (CRED → Create, Read, Edit, Delete)
  - Fields (FLS → Field Level Security)
  - Apps, Tabs, Record Types, Page Layouts
- Example: *Sales Profile* can access Leads & Opportunities but not Cases.

![Profile Setup](images/profile.png)

---

### 3. **Permission Sets**
- Grant extra permissions **without cloning/changing profiles**
- Assignable to multiple users
- Example: Create *Report Access Permission Set* → Give access to Dashboards → Assign to Sales Reps.

![Permission Set](images/permission_set.png)

---

### 4. **Roles & Role Hierarchy**
- **Roles define record visibility** (who can see whose records)
- Hierarchy: CEO → Sales Manager → Sales Rep
- Example: Sales Manager can see all records of Sales Reps under them.

```text
CEO
 └── VP of Sales
      └── Sales Manager
            └── Sales Reps






### 5. Organization-Wide Defaults (OWD)

- Sets the baseline level of record access.

Example: Opportunities OWD = Private → Only owner & managers see records.

- Object	OWD Setting	Meaning
- Accounts	Public Read/Write	Everyone can view & edit
- Opportunities	Private	Only owner & manager can see
- Cases	Public Read Only	Everyone can view, but only owner can edit

###6. Sharing Rules

- Used to open up access (cannot restrict)

- Example: Share Opportunities (Private OWD) with Marketing Group as Read Only

### 7. Login Access Policies

- Restrict logins by:

- IP Ranges (e.g., 192.168.x.x only)

- Login Hours (Mon–Fri 9 AM–6 PM)

- Example: Disallow login outside office hours.

### 8. Password Policies

- Setup → Password Policies

- Example:

- Min length = 8

- Require special char & number

- Lockout after 3 failed attempts

- Expire after 90 days

### 9. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- Mandatory for Salesforce logins

- User verifies with:

- Salesforce Authenticator app

- OTP via SMS/email

- Security key

# 📦 Standard & Custom Objects in Salesforce

Objects are the **database tables** in Salesforce that store records.  
They are the backbone of the Salesforce data model.

---

## 📌 Types of Objects

| Type        | Description | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Standard Objects** | Pre-built by Salesforce | Account, Contact, Lead, Opportunity, Case |
| **Custom Objects**   | Created by Admins to store unique business data | Invoice, Project, Student__c |

---

## ⚙️ Working with Objects

### 1. **Standard Objects**
- Available by default in Salesforce
- Cannot delete, but can customize (fields, page layouts, record types)

📍 Example: *Account* stores company details, *Opportunity* stores potential deals.

---

### 2. **Custom Objects**
- Created to store data unique to business
- Naming: `ObjectName__c`
- Steps:
  - Setup → Objects → Create Custom Object
  - Example: *Invoice__c*
    - Fields: Invoice Number, Amount, Due Date
    - Relationships: Lookup to Account

![Custom Object](images/custom_object.png)

---

## 📊 Fields in Objects

| Field Type      | Description | Example |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Text**        | Short string | Customer Name |
| **Number**      | Numeric values | Order Amount |
| **Checkbox**    | Boolean true/false | Active Customer |
| **Picklist**    | Dropdown options | Lead Status (New, Working, Closed) |
| **Formula**     | Auto-calculated values | Age = TODAY() – DOB |
| **Lookup**      | Relationship to another object | Contact linked to Account |
| **Master-Detail** | Strong parent-child relationship | Invoice Line → Invoice |

---

## 🔗 Object Relationships

### 1. **Lookup Relationship**
- Loose connection between objects
- Child record **can exist without parent**
- Example: Contact (child) → Account (parent)

### 2. **Master-Detail Relationship**
- Strong dependency
- Child **cannot exist without parent**
- Parent controls child’s ownership, security, deletion
- Example: Opportunity Product → Opportunity

### 3. **Many-to-Many Relationship**
- Implemented using a **junction object**
- Example: Students ↔ Courses (StudentCourse__c junction object)

---

## 📑 Record Types & Page Layouts

### **Record Types**
- Different business processes for the same object
- Example: Opportunity Record Types → *New Business*, *Renewal*

### **Page Layouts**
- Control fields, sections, related lists visible on record page
- Can assign different layouts to different profiles

---

## 🖼️ Schema Builder

- Graphical tool to view & manage objects and relationships
- Setup → Schema Builder
- Example: See how *Account*, *Contact*, *Opportunity* are linked

![Schema Builder](images/schema_builder.png)

---

## 💡 Example Scenario

**Business Need:**  
ABC Corp wants to track **Projects** in Salesforce.

- Create **Custom Object: Project__c**
  - Fields: Project Name, Start Date, End Date, Budget
  - Lookup to Account
- Create **Record Types:**
  - Internal Project
  - Client Project
- Create **Page Layouts:**
  - Internal Project Layout
  - Client Project Layout

Now, **Managers** can track all projects linked to Accounts.

---

## 🖼️ Diagram: Object Relationships

```text
Account (Standard)
   |
   |---< Contact (Standard)
   |
   |---< Project__c (Custom)
           |
           |---< Task (Standard)

Automation in Salesforce helps reduce manual work, enforce consistency, and increase efficiency.  
Admins can configure **declarative automation tools** without writing code.

---

## 📌 Automation Tools in Salesforce

| **Process Builder** | More advanced automation with multiple criteria. | Update Account when Opportunity closes. |
| **Flows** | Visual tool for complex automation (record-triggered, screen flows, scheduled). | Guide users through case resolution. |
| **Approval Processes** | Route records for approval. | Discount approval process for Sales. |

---

## 🛠️ Workflow Rules

- Connectors (Define path)

---

## ✅ Approval Processes

- Automates **multi-step approval routing**.
- Supports:
  - Entry criteria
  - Multiple approval steps
  - Approvers (User, Role, Queue)
  - Actions (Email alert, field update, outbound message)

📍 Example:  
Discount Approval:
- If **Discount > 20%**, send to Manager.
- If **Discount > 40%**, send to VP.

---

## 📐 Example Scenario

**Business Case:**  
Company wants automation when a high-value Opportunity closes.

1. Use a **Record-Triggered Flow** on Opportunity.  
2. Criteria: **Stage = Closed Won & Amount > $50k**.  
3. Actions:
