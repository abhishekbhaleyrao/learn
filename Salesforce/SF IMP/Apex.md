# INTRODUCTION
- Object Oriented Programming Language
  - Supports classes, interfaces and inheritance
  - Uses Java like syntax 
- Strongly typed
  - Validates references to objects at compile time.
- Integrated with the database.
  - Provides direct access to records and their fields.
- Enable developers to add business logics to system events, including button clicks,
related record updates, Visualforce pages and Lightning Components.
- One can call apex code through Web Service request and Triggers on Objects.

# Apex is:

## Integrated
- Provides built-in support for common Lightning Platform idioms
## Easy to Use
- Uses syntax and semantics which are easy teuse and understand.
- Apex is based on familiar Java Idioms.
## Data Focused
- Provides transactional access to the database, allows you to roll back operations.
## Rigorous
- Strongly typed language that uses direct references to schema objects such as
Qbject and fields API.
## Hosted
- It is executed, and controlled entirely by Lightning Platform.
## Multi tenant Aware
- Apex runs in multi tenant environment like rest of Lightning Platform.
## Easy to Test
- Apex provides built-in support for unit test creation and execution. Test
results indicate how much code is covered.
## Versioned
- One can save apex code against different versions of the API.

# Apex is included in:

- Performance Edition
- Unlimited Edition
- Developer Edition
- Enterprise Edition
- Database.com


# Use Apex when you want to:

- Create Web and Email Services.
- Perform Complex validation over more than one objects.
- Create complex business logics those cannot be implemented by FLOWS.
- Create custom logic that occurs over the entire transaction.
- Attach custom logic to another operation, such as Create/Update/Save a
  record, so that it occurs whenever the operation is executed, regardless it
  originates in Ul, VF or from API.
