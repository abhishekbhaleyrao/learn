# OBJECTS (Standard & Custom)
## Introduction
- An Object is very similar to a database table in the Force.com platform.
- The platform comes with a number of standard objects like Account, Contact, Case, Lead, Opportunity, etc.
- The standard objects support default apps like Salesforce Sales and Salesforce Service.
- We can create Custom Objects in Salesforce as per requirement of the project.

# TABS
## Introduction
- Through Tabs we can navigate around an app.
- Every tab serves as the starting point for viewing, editing & entering information for a specific object.
- When we click a tab, the corresponding home page that object appears.
- For example, if we click the Accounts tab, the Accounts tab home page appears. 
It gives you access to all of the account records. We can view details of a particular record by clicking on it on it.
